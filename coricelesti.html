                Celesti was the name that Adolf NS recorded his solo music under from 1997 to 2003. All of the music was
                written, performed, and recorded by NS, with the occasional guest on songs along the way.</p>
            <p>There were 13 Cori Celesti albums, an EP, a collection of covers, and three compilation releases,
                consisting of songs that were not included on the albums at the time of recording. All of the music was
                recorded on a 4-track, and most of the music was released on cassette. Four later releases are available
                on Bandcamp (see link), but as most of the music was put out on cassette, it will probably never see the
                light of day. 2013 saw the release of <i>All's
                    Well That Ends Well</i>, a collection of recordings taken from albums that were recorded between
                2000 and 2003.</p>
