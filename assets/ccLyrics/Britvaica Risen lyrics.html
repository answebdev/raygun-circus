      <h1>Britvaica Risen</h1>
      <p>

        <p><b>WAYWARD SOULS</b></p>

        don't tell me you care. tell me you Care. you may get tossed by the wind, but,...can you really fly? a
        Stranger's prize ("i <i>know</i> when my mother died") - he'll still clutch the gun in his hand. lying there in
        the vegetable garden with the cabbage and the blood in the dirt. T.A. reconsidered - suicide's for clams (as the
        opera house went up in flames). drift on by and you might as well get boiled up in stew (your worthless stench
        of blood makes me cry like onions. besides, i'm cold and hungry [and boats are made to sink]). from the heart of
        Emptiness and Nothing comes a pioneer on his horse, but, he doesn't understand the Gift.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>HEUTE</b></p>

        &#60;SNIP&#62; mirror soul - glass shards at the point of impact. -frames per second. flicker flicker. run
        away,...forever. heads in a room will forever spin: flicker-spin-flicker...faster and faster. "what did you
        say?" drilling a hole to Heaven because the crows are dull tonight. transcendental carpenters (their pockets
        lined with gold). &#60;SPLICE&#62; googoogloogoo. the perforated sheet's bloodstained fate (find me through the
        opening). love in fragments. three stains of blood. dot dot dot. sturphriKArppet. hate by numbers. Pollack
        anger: epileptic machine. shudder. Mustarddrippedstrewnpunches. love like a wounded nurse - it <i>is</i>
        necessarily so. a Cyber Messiah injection to uncalm the still sea (nostalgic novelty crumbs neonly decorate a
        million faces). a falling leaf is dreadful. anxious - very anxious - for presents. trapped in nature. "caw caw!"
        if no one's here, who is? you're dragged off by a steel horse until you're able to run on your own. run for your
        lives. run to your hives. a man of tomorrow with a scissorscarred face. multidrabbed iron circle never stops.
        spilled. so shall you.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>CURSED</b></p>

        there's Doctor Clash with the Third Reich harp players<br />
        take poison in through the ear<br />
        <p></p>
        there's a death in the west<br />
        in a graveyard towards the back<br />
        the foliage noise blocks its cross<br />
        <p></p>
        half a billion heard<br />
        half a billion sold<br />
        nostalgia selling like speed<br />
        <p></p>
        8000 listen to the trumpets of angels<br />
        whose voices are heard through the pull of a string<br />
        <p></p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red carpet for you from the mouth of the serpent<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hitchhike on the scorpion's tail<br />
        <p></p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the desert some faint cries by the Bloodshot Cowboys<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guided by Luke the Drifter<br />
        <p></p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death in the night<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sunset brings new tomorrows<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;melts on a new plastic body that glows<br />
        <p></p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thrown away dreams found by cats in the gutter<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scavenged and lit up for a brand new life<br />
        <p></p>
        culture transfusion with watered down feedback<br />
        plucking gold hair from the lonely paupers<br />
        <p></p>
        twenty years ago<br />
        the painted men of straw<br />
        na&#239;ve: they tore off the unshaven head<br />
        <p></p>
        illusions of free will when still part of the game<br />
        Johnny cries: "la me fa sol"<br />
        <p></p>
        bringing in money with crumbs from the trashcan<br />
        the army's always here to sing you a hymn<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>NURSERY APOCALYPSE</b></p>

        we'd often spend the whole day staring at the window with our eyes of magnet. we'd seek for answers in the sky,
        but all we'd see was the Dark Lady weaving with her many arms (we paradised in a barren desert). my sister was
        convinced, but i sensed nothing - but one can always be disabled (i supposed). i took you to the City of Ashes
        where we'd see the children spying from the pyres. if i would hear, this might be illusion - but for now, the
        tunnel vision inhibits. "Rise up!" roared an infant. ...she was always deaf to the sound of nothing. she would
        need her head on a stake. i'm swarmed with lollipop kisses and dandelion touches. pacifier penetration from the
        eyes of rolling thunder. i'm strangled, but can see the black light. though i already knew, i was merely a
        teacher (my rolling head was used as textbook). i would scrawl of the tipping of the scales by giggly vinegar
        fumes.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>A CHISELER'S DANCE</b></p>

        there's a halo in her closet and it's scaly to the touch (the messenger-angel had failed to seduce her with such
        gifts. she'd rather toss the stones over her shoulder - would He be mad!). and now, the village is on fire. but,
        she walks through the flames with her sack of rocks in her hand - her shadow followed by her newborn children.
        "just think of it as Nothing," she'd say. there is Nothing. you are Nothing. Nothing. "but, grab a chisel and
        take yourself to the Canyon (nobody goes there)." some let angels bring them comfort, others bask in the gentle
        unstable fumes (all these gaseous bodies collapse and explode). though her statues tip their golden crowns to
        her, she often Forgets.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>BRITVAIC IDEAL</b></p>

        there are no serpents in this temple - no sound of hissing, shades of slithers. driven out by discipline (we
        stand alone in our ideal - we've scratched a circled "A" with nails and toothpicks on the lense of our mind's
        eye). but, in our sphere, the walls are torn asunder, and new buttresses of hope are erected. our eyes are
        pierced by arrows from bows and slingshots and we laugh,...how we laughed. the gleaming shrine attracts by
        numbers - who will sit atop this swaying throne (and in my mind, the dream is ending - i know it would never
        happen. <i>and the na&#239;ve shall recognize their judgment.</i>)? fear the rubble (a black light shoots
        through my head) - a quarry is what they want. i stand alone - eyes closed - and expect nothing (i'll even be
        selfish and lick the wall, in hopes of severing my tongue - "straighten up those spikes!" they'd say). there is
        no wait. i'm thrown into the ruins.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>BODHISATTVA</b></p>

        we shall steal the sun for ourselves. i've imprisoned Avalokita in my cuckoo clock (feathers combed with semen:
        "kukukukuku..."). obliterate the senses with year-old candle wax. seven times it's been snuffed out. boring
        wounds on a Kuroe-Cho hill to fly away with crusted wings (until then, you'll hang like a rusted chocolate
        warrior with your arms ripped off). a toast to the shining corpse (we've waited for so long). orange cakes for
        baby - there goes the smokestack. posed before the people: xylophoneribsmacked. locking Euchrid in a stable with
        the goats. his flapping skin was ripped off his hands and stuffed down his throat. the children gathered 'round
        and laughed because he wore a diaper (they would not listen) - a fish hung from his side by a silk string. [so i
        shall steal it for my own ("kukukukuku..." they would not listen)]. i'm etched in cheese with lead pipes through
        my hands and feet.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>ANNIHILATION ZERO</b></p>

        a tree made of seashells lights the top of the hill, you're welcomed to it - a stool awaits you (don't forget
        the toothpicks). a shortage of gods on a golden dawn. a pile of rotting hands relaxes under a shady tree.
        wasteland cries from the spiders. we can rent the Resurrection and watch it in slow motion (this will do
        instead). the sun goes down and a cry has been lifted. where were you yesterday? swapping souls with the king's
        cattle. faking departure in the Bardo. in the ruins lies a walnut - crack it open if you can. swallow the earth
        with the shells in your teeth. lost your glasses underwater. where's that smokescreen coming from? upright
        posture for climbing flagpoles. teething teething. greeting the velcro. swallowing purple. doubting digits. yes.
        this is the way ("come on in"). more more more. haunting in the zero hour. rockbellyuplift. this is it. stroll
        through the beach with your hammer and nails,...searching... nuclear babies dipped in vinegar for pollen.
        watching from the plastic trees and flinging grenades. accidental devils from the iron womb. going bankrupt in
        the cinders. getting sleepy in the ashes.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>EMPIRE</b></p>

        a Buddha's on the table<br />
        wearing a popsicle smile<br />
        his face is painted green<br />
        and he's veiled in Marywhite<br />
        massage his stomach, squeeze his cheeks<br />
        and coins fall from his mouth<br />
        if you're heard declaring,<br />
        "Christianity's stupid, we are good,"<br />
        he'll make sure Smith sinks you<br />
        McCarthy's bust is glowing<br />
        in the corner of the room<br />
        reminding you, "you'd better find some things<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to sell, or else"<br />
        it is cold, but still you wear your coat to fight<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heat<br />
        <p></p>
        transparent coffins line the floor<br />
        like sardines in a can<br />
        life supports and wires buzzing<br />
        i can see you smile<br />
        and now you're watching television<br />
        while you're fast asleep<br />
        "i'm in a hurry - pull this knob,<br />
        it's time to have a kid"<br />
        we're learning to be gods<br />
        before we learn to be human<br />
        <i>and if you come with me now<br />
          you won't have to stay awake</i><br />
        the fat man's shadow sits alone<br />
        next to a matching vase<br />
        our fading shadow sits alone<br />
        next to a matching vase<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>STRING OF GOLD</b></p>

        the tumbleweed strewn road is paved with gold<br />
        and we're locked into the center of the world<br />
        yes, these restless nights will stay with us<br />
        we'll dream of pitter-patter guns<br />
        we've watched our pumping heart stop on the table<br />
        our handbag's full of brand new symbols<br />
        our skulls have all been sewn together<br />
        DECENTRALIZATION praise the rich who hear our footsteps<br />
        <p></p>
        our crafted sack has gotten fuller<br />
        inside, there's a struggle to breathe<br />
        all the wood chips stick together<br />
        some have even fallen out<br />
        2030 echos ring the halls: "it's getting better"<br />
        shooting sperm into the engine<br />
        fuel injection<br />
        sell some blood<br />
        <p></p>
        meanwhile, in the coming blackout<br />
        stand beneath a tree of strychnine<br />
        on our knees we search (our sack tore)<br />
        the trees are sprouting lepers from their limbs<br />
        lost all money, serial numbers<br />
        i don't remember who my friends are<br />
        "it's quite all right, we'll take a shortcut<br />
        with string of gold, we'll build another"<br />
