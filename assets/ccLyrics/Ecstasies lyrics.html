      <h1>Man Of A Thousand Ecstasies</h1>
      <p>
        <p><b>BARBARA'S WIKKO</b></p>

        "Excuse me, Madame - where are you going?" You had rushed off, and I did not have the chance to speak to you.
        You were in a hurry, though. Your hands were in the air. "Miss...are you a butterfly?" I could tell because you
        wore the colors. When I heard you smile, I thought I knew what you'd been up to, but I guess I didn't. "Where
        are you going now? I want to know." I wanted to know. I never did realize why you left me on the swing set. I
        was left alone. But, I guess you had your matters to attend to. I never did see you again. "How are you now?" I
        wondered. I'd wonder just once more...where did you run to?<br />

        <p><b>DON JUAN</b></p>

        <p>There we were in the ocean, before our shipwreck. It was me and thirty others. We had not eaten for days, and
          I had my dog that my father gave me before he passed away. Having not eaten for days, I no longer had my dog.
          I knew my neighbor who was there too. I didn't know him anymore either. There was a Turk. He liked to handle
          little girls. He was there too. And, the priest liked his son...or me. The Turk was there too.
          <i>M&#228;dchenfresser!</i> (and <i>-handler</i>).</p>

        <p>I was the only one left. I was on the beach. A girl took me up and left me in a cave. Her father didn't like
          me anyways (nor even Zoe). She dressed me up like a Turk too. But, I did not get the girl, or Zoe.</p>
