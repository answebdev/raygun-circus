      <h1>A Miner Stripped</h1>
      <p>
        <p><b>VENETIAN VACATION</b></p>

        Nikki sat with eyes wide open<br />
        Thinking hard and gazing softly<br />
        Planting her tears in the sand<br />
        Swore she saw Gibbons before his fall to grace<br />
        <p></p>
        Picked herself up from the rubble<br />
        Carefully sunned herself dry<br />
        "Isn't it all so nostalgic?<br />
        I think I'll slip this rock into my bra"<br />
        <p></p>
        Juan, he leans back in his chair<br />
        Strokes his chin and states his thesis<br />
        Me, I've heard it all before<br />
        Like when he once spoke of civil rights<br />
        <p></p>
        Now he strokes the hair of History<br />
        Dives into a golden well<br />
        And he's plowing his bulldozer<br />
        Over my town just to find a coin or two<br />
        <p></p>
        Chorus:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like our Venetian escape<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From one's hobby springs a god<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking vitamins with water<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helps you to distinguish right from wrong<br />
        <p></p>
        And the major dreams of pastures<br />
        Wonders what it would be like<br />
        And he tells us of his sheep dreams<br />
        Right before we're led into debate<br />
        <p></p>
        And with elbows on the table<br />
        We produce a golden quilt<br />
        Though we're masters of this lost skill<br />
        It's basically just a waste of time and means nothing<br />
        <p></p>
        Chorus<br />
        <p></p>
        Nikki sat with eyes wide open<br />
        Thinking hard and gazing softly<br />
        Went to Italy last summer<br />
        Wrote a book, but I wasn't surprised<br />
        <p></p>
        Juan, he also went there too<br />
        Proposed a goal at a big conference<br />
        And this time I'm ready for him<br />
        Grabbed my rifle from beneath my bed<br />
        <p></p>
        Chorus</br>

        </br>
        <p><b>DOWN THERE</b></p>

        In the corner of the basement<br />
        Stands a chair that you once sat in<br />
        With your beads and cup of spirits<br />
        Muttering in this dingy haven<br />
        And the ever dangling light bulb<br />
        Swings above you like a pendulum<br />
        And it's full of dust and cobwebs<br />
        But it still gives light to you down there<br />
        <p></p>
        And the bubble man is talking<br />
        'Cause you're telling crazy stories<br />
        Still the neighbors never saw you<br />
        Dancing or telling your lies<br />
        Now the hurricane is coming<br />
        (It's a lighthouse in the fog)<br />
        But the only thing faith's left you<br />
        Is a tombstone with your name<br />
        Down there<br />
        <p></p>
        Today's a special morning<br />
        You've got on your brand new suit<br />
        And you've gone to pay a visit<br />
        To a friend down the boulevard<br />
        And he's shaking red with anger<br />
        'Cause you've sabotaged his image<br />
        And he'll send you to his brother<br />
        To the devil you will go down there<br />
        <p></p>
        Your life is now in shambles<br />
        And you've cut off your own head<br />
        And you did not listen to me<br />
        When I did not say a thing<br />
        I'm just fine with a used candle<br />
        Sleeping underneath a closed sign<br />
        And I'm dreaming like a baby<br />
        But you'll probably still see me down there<br />
        <p></p>
        In the corner of the basement<br />
        Stands a chair that you once sat in<br />
        With your beads and cup of spirits<br />
        Muttering in this dingy haven<br />
        And the ever dangling light bulb<br />
        Swings above you like a pendulum<br />
        Still I'm dreaming like a baby<br />
        And you'll probably see me down there<br />

        </br>
        <p><b>SKELETON SHIP</b></p>

        In the afternoon I heard you cry<br />
        It was all 'cause I didn't ask why<br />
        She insisted that I should react<br />
        So I put on a dress and her hat<br />
        <p></p>
        The gumball machine gave me blue<br />
        I most certainly knew what to do<br />
        For the benefit of humankind:<br />
        Count the goose bumps on every giraffe -<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something useless<br />
        <p></p>
        The scholar's ear has fallen off<br />
        On his shoe it had begun to froth<br />
        His ideas and analyses<br />
        His hunger pains with wine he'd tease<br />
        <p></p>
        The block of cheese has been quite ill<br />
        It's sporing fur of green and white<br />
        It just wants to be left alone<br />
        To die undisturbed by the hype<br />
        <p></p>
        The vegetables dance to their tunes<br />
        In the garden they're singing for you<br />
        "If a cow could it'd eat you," one preached<br />
        Though persuasive, you'd vote for the carrot<br />

        <p></p>

        CHORUS:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the skeleton ship<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skins point to land<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the bones sink the ship<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flesh on the mast takes up drinking<br />
        <p></p>
        The theorist strikes once again<br />
        In a museum he brings in the crowds<br />
        Like a thief I lift up the display case<br />
        Disappointed - no lost jewels, just air!<br />
        <p></p>
        And you nurture your fate in this lot<br />
        Collect baggage and other what-nots<br />
        But you'll always be late for the train<br />
        'Cause you spend all your time packing luggage<br />
        <p></p>
        And the girl with the beak with Abstraction she'd lay<br />
        Though blind to what these nights produced she'd stay<br />
        She had no idea she was always alone<br />
        As with blinking she'd always dishevel her bed<br />
        To make you think she wasn't alone<br />
        <p></p>
        CHORUS<br />
        <p></p>
        The acrobat swings in the air<br />
        He soars high so he thinks he must care<br />
        There's no safety net down below<br />
        But it's all right as long as his eyes stay closed<br />
        <p></p>
        And she's choking to death on a rock<br />
        She survived and just kept to the grass<br />
        But she overdosed on vitamins<br />
        And got killed by a bus just the same<br />
        <p></p>
        You're hoping for what everyone wants<br />
        But it's what you most certainly fear<br />
        And it'll probably torment you in Hell<br />
        I'll just buy you a god, wife, or cat<br />
        <p></p>
        CHORUS<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>PARADOX</b></p>

        halfway to reality. and halfway to again. again and again. never reach the mark. the waltzing candle's flame
        will never touch me. halfway to ("oh weary feet"), but still a rose is etched in stone. symbols squeezed of
        liquid gold upon a tombstone where a Zen dog's mouthing "no no no." just like jelly. i crush the numbers in my
        palm. i'm munching on a cracker. and a flask of poison words is shrined beneath the bed. i sense the smell of
        oysters, bite my lip, and then stay silent. halfway in the strychnine egg. "hold your tongue, that you may get
        there," i whisper secretly to my other hand. you leapfrog towards infinity. build your kingdom in the quicksand.
        if you could touch me, you would know me. i can wait forever, and for now, i'll laugh in silence.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>ATLANTIS REVISITED</b></p>

        How would you feel today if I left you in the sea?<br />
        At the very bottom<br />
        All alone with no key<br />
        Would you play in the sand?<br />
        Or stretch out your hands<br />
        Like the way that you did<br />
        When you stood like a statue<br />
        In my bathroom<br />
        With a potato in your palm?<br />
        <p></p>
        How sweet you looked with your hands and face pressed to the glass<br />
        Sailing towards your destination<br />
        Swimming with all the fish<br />
        Would you miss me at all?<br />
        Or enjoy your new life?<br />
        Or shout out loud<br />
        Because you couldn't get out?<br />
        Then you'd complain<br />
        That the slugs 'round your toes crawl too slowly<br />
        <p></p>
        How would you feel if you knew what's happening in your room?<br />
        Yes, but there's nothing you can do<br />
        About the excavations<br />
        There's so much to find out<br />
        'Cause we must know it all<br />
        And I must tell you that<br />
        It beats collecting stamps<br />
        Or lint from holes<br />
        Or philosophies from the east<br />
        <p></p>
        How would you feel today if I left you in the sea?<br />
        Searching for some buried treasure<br />
        Just to kill all the time<br />
        We now know all your dreams<br />
        Though boring some seem<br />
        But they've been jotted down<br />
        Anyways, just in case...<br />
        Wouldn't you know?<br />
        We know you better than you<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>A MINER STRIPPED</b></p>

        Consider this a second warning<br />
        Silly boy blue has been laid to sleep<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he saw tomorrow's skies<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was only the haze<br />
        And now he's drinking coffee with the boys<br />
        <p></p>
        And searching deep, he thought he had us fooled<br />
        The many colors looked ridiculous<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wondered how a horse would dance<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shot a fox, panicked and ran<br />
        He knew it was the right thing to do<br />
        <p></p>
        When we're not laughing, we ignore it<br />
        It may be harsh, but that's how things go<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may not like what Hobbes had said<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But noxious we've become instead<br />
        A miner stripped of his sense of depth<br />
        <p></p>
        He's often working for a king<br />
        He never needs to bring a thing<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diamonds that he's searching for<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are to him just a great, big bore<br />
        A miner stripped of his stones for coal<br />
        <p></p>
        So now I hear he's made a comeback<br />
        We're behind him with a push and shove<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his tools, he's worked a sweat<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's been stripped down to rags by now<br />
        I think it was very therapeutic<br />
        <p></p>
        I don't want to tell you again, my boy<br />
        Time will tell what you've learned (if you have)<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I've prepared to observe<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I recognized that sound...<br />
        The miner stripped his diamonds for coal<br />
        <p></p>
        A miner stripped diamonds for coal<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>SHE OF FANCIES</b></p>

        I'm hoping I can get back home. I hope I can get back in my body before I'm left here all alone - just bones. I
        don't like the many faces. They warm their ears up with bananas. And they all toss their dirty glances as if
        I've been running around the city naked. She's grown bored of her new philosophy. She wants to get into my skin
        in search of a brand new illusion (again). But, I'm sorry I've nothing to offer. There's nothing in here but
        some dust, a suitcase, and a broken pencil - that's all! Now she's coming with a great big crowbar. And, she is
        looking for my kidneys to stuff with great, big, bloated hornets (how nice). She's got pinwheel eyes. And you
        spin them around like in Russian Roulette. With a gun to her head, she's a smile on her face. Now, I find myself
        out in the streets like some old pervert on the beat. My hands are seen inside my pocket on my hip. And she's
        happy with my sense of nothing, until she buys some brand new earmuffs (though I kept telling her it might as
        well had been dirt). She's got pinwheel eyes. And you spin them around like in Russian Roulette. With a gun to
        her head, she's a smile on her face. A knife in her back - no, she wouldn't have that.<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>SPHINX</b></p>

        Deep inside of the cathedral<br />
        Stands a man with rolled up bills<br />
        And he's thinking that he should of stayed in bed<br />
        And the red streets that he walked through (just last night)<br />
        Already miss him<br />
        So he grabs his coat and heads out for the door<br />
        <p></p>
        There's nothing wrong with revenge<br />
        If it keeps your home real silent<br />
        The unicorn's been spotted on the beach<br />
        And the sinners are now winners<br />
        And the crippled man is fodder<br />
        When you're witnessing the crowning of a frog<br />
        <p></p>
        Still, please don't let me hold on<br />
        To the greatest love of your life<br />
        "What if Mussolini wore a dress?"<br />
        Your quaint critical conclusions<br />
        Are like Cat's games underwater<br />
        They're as useless as a big hole in my head<br />
        <p></p>
        Now the frog, he'd like to thank you<br />
        For your attentive attention<br />
        No one thought he'd ever make it big<br />
        And the body in his closet<br />
        Drops his chin with understanding<br />
        They'll be happy for some many years to come<br />
        <p></p>
        Now you're inside the cathedral<br />
        You've left town (I heard you talking)<br />
        Possession of guilt never felt so good<br />
        And you'd had enough amusement for the day<br />
        It's not your circus<br />
        As you left you gave a postcard to the priest<br />

        <br />
        <p><b>HOW THE APPRENTICE'S CONSCIOUSNESS KILLED HIM</b></p>

        he pricked his thumb to test the point. the drop of blood meant go on. he's off to weave with eyes wide open. to
        beckon with the slightest hint. i'm offering my skull for practice, and he rides in on a slug. i tell him where
        to shove the needle. have him choose the color thread. purple is for unicorns. red is for a candy cane. yellow's
        for a night with Lisa. white is for a New Tomorrow,...so he threw that one away. and though i feel the tug
        between my ears, i can still hear the coughing cat. and all i wanted was a kiss from Nero, and he bragged of
        shaking Pilate's hand. he thought he knew it all like the back of his hand, but there's no room in here for the
        living. how they'd laugh at the sight of him. he'd be a walking "Pin the Tail on the Donkey" with those banners
        pinned to his face. they laughed at his obsessions and at his most embarassing thoughts (i never knew this side
        of mother). so i finished him off with his very own dreams. and all the while, my eyes were shut.<br />


        <br />
        <p><b>PILGRIM</b></p>

        Right from before the start<br />
        The gentleman sailed away<br />
        He promised the whole universe<br />
        He'd digress from disappointment<br />
        This is the way we start to sing<br />
        Away, map carved in his back<br />
        The pilgrim from the sea<br />
        Situation's beyond your control<br />
        Still you stop for a bite to eat<br />
        Situation beyond your concern<br />
        But you must have a reason to live<br />
        This is the way we smashed his face<br />
        As I sat rigid in my chair<br />
        I envisioned myself getting lost<br />
        <p></p>
        Dive into a pool full of lips<br />
        They are chattering away their teeth<br />
        Although you forgot your bathing suit<br />
        It's all right 'cause they're talking to you<br />
        The man stole a country for his name<br />
        Now he wants to get into my skull<br />
        But I told him never mind<br />
        I had changed it just last week<br />
        This is the way the body's found<br />
        Dirty, but clean just the same<br />
        It was hidden beneath my bed<br />
        To the house of god you will go<br />
        Or to hot dog stands in the east<br />
        Many rolls of film to be bought<br />
        The pilgrim from the sea<br />
        <p></p>
        You are racing around the world<br />
        On a rocking horse made of veal<br />
        And you're convinced that you will win<br />
        'Cause you gave it enough to eat<br />
        Through the ghost town you will ride<br />
        Coming back for the seventh time<br />
        Hearing voices to reproduce them<br />
        He's the pilgrim from the sea<br />
        This is the way you read a book<br />
        When I heard you talking to her<br />
        I knew I did not want to read Rice<br />
        And they say that gold falls from your mouth<br />
        So I pried in while you were asleep<br />
        All I found was a piece of cheese<br />
        This is the pilgrim from the sea<br />
        <p></p>
        This is the way you've tricked yourself<br />
        You may run after me and catch me<br />
        But you'll never give me that kiss<br />
        It gets you through the nights<br />
        Especially when fast asleep<br />
        I don't understand it at all<br />
        So I will not say a thing<br />
        This is the way you count your z's<br />
        We will steal them until you have none...<br />
        Little things amuse me<br />
        But, this is no little thing<br />
        I guess you like what you like<br />
        He's the pilgrim from the sea<br />
