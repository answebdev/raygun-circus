      <p><b>ZERO ZERO IN THE YELLOW-STAINED AMPHIBIOUS BOTTLE<br />
          OF POACHED PERCEPTION, OR 9 O'CLOCK P.M.</b></p>

      The round and round<br />
      The round and round<br />
      It was a long time, no<br />
      It was a long time?<br />
      No!<br />
      But, over too soon<br />
      But it all depends<br />
      On which end of the gun you're standing on<br />
      Behind<br />
      <i>Oder?</i><br />
      Behind<br />
      <p></p>
      Behind the feedbacklife<br />
      Life as a bad habit<br />
      A knife in the dark<br />
      Your voice<br />
      No depth, no substance<br />
      'Tis merely objective<br />
      An observation of the physical qualities of a sound wave<br />
      Clearly, the essence of secondhand perception<br />
      The byproduct of cause<br />
      The essence of two-dimensionality<br />
      <p></p>
      Perception flawed<br />
      A piece of paper torn in half<br />
      Milk, sandpaper and snow<br />
      All blended together in a great black pot<br />
      In my ear<br />
      And dubbed<br />
      Mixed down with effects<br />
      Did it have to be black?<br />
      <p></p>
      You had called me on this particular plane<br />
      Apologies for Inconvenience<br />
      Reception as null<br />
      Revelation in the Null Null<br />
      Of substance<br />
      A moment <i>im Klo</i><br />
      Of mind<br />
      A moment in infinity<br />
      In the third, in the Next<br />
      Two seconds later<br />
      See you tomorrow<br />
      Don't want to miss you<br />
      <i>Lach kanosch</i><br />
      Don't know - to hear you<br />
      <i>Lach kanosch</i><br />
      Sketchy sketchy<br />

      <p><b>PROGRESS ON A BLIP SCREEN</b></p>

      Today I chipped my tooth<br />
      The calcium never pays<br />
      The fields of milk they lie<br />
      They lie and stroke like silk<br />
      I'm writing a letter<br />
      To an answering machine that just hoards voices<br />
      Each letter is a postcard<br />
      A collage<br />
      A documentation<br />
      A scrapyard full of bones<br />
      Full of chips and lips and hits<br />
      Each addressed to no one<br />
      (Apparently)<br />
      Please return to sender<br />
      <p></p>
      There was another girl with a broken tooth<br />
      I could've sworn her name was Nikki<br />
      But, we both knew it wasn't<br />
      There were many of them with the same name<br />
      The red and black hair<br />
      Both alike, yet not<br />
      A series of fits<br />
      Of epileptic seizures from one's imagination<br />
      Or just a broken melody on a banjo<br />
      And there was a structure<br />
      But, their names were never Nikki<br />
      Besides, those destined for Italy<br />
      Have merely five seconds to live<br />
      A long time, no?<br />
      <p></p>
      Tonight, the arms fell off my clock<br />
      But, that's all right<br />
      Now we can no longer be crucified<br />
      We have better things to do, anyway<br />
      Than to go around trying to be martyrs<br />
      A crutch and a medal<br />
      Those things are for those with swimming pools<br />
      And for those who hold their heads up high<br />
      With cosmetic surgery and helium balloons<br />
      I prefer the liquid crutch<br />
      If I want hallucinations<br />
      I want to enjoy them<br />
      <br />

      <p><b>KITTY BOYS</b></p>

      Peace is the word of Existence<br />
      Crushed is the thought of its Fate<br />
      Flowers paint mood of the table<br />
      Thorns pierce the side of your leg<br />
      Why must you hide under false smiles?<br />
      Attribute them to Everything<br />
      Peel the dead skin off your lipstick:<br />
      White breasts of nature unveiled<br />
      <p></p>
      Children grow up in a locked cell<br />
      Laced with chocolate distractions<br />
      Rocks, horses, flowers... -- all happy:<br />
      Biped ventriloquism<br />
      In a world where nothing dies<br />
      (Passing to another place)<br />
      There is no reason to worry<br />
      Throw your voice to everything<br />
      <p></p>
      Children of the snow eat candy<br />
      ROBOtic COPulation<br />
      Smiling and sewing the fabric<br />
      Static vibes fly through the air<br />
      Drink from the grail of misfortune<br />
      Or just a kick in the head<br />
      "Wake up! Get out of my nightmares."<br />
      Keep your door open for light<br />
      <p></p>
      Peace is the word of Existence<br />
      Crushed is the thought of its Fate<br />
      You can have candy cane meal times<br />
      But, notice the razors inside<br />
      <br />

      <p><b>JINGO JANGLE</b></p>

      <p>Walk into the bank. Keep your eyes directly in front of you. On the streets walk the blind. They bend down
        and read the cracks on the sidewalk with their fingertips. The newspapers are all painted black. You read the
        smeared ink just the same. You pull out the penknife and take out some money. Play your part in Democracy. The
        consumption of commodities: the only part you have.</p>

      <p>Under the terrorist flag. The red, white and who? Acts of aggression under a different, more agreeable term.
        Fighting For Freedom. Your assessment and acceptability of the situation at hand has been manufactured.
        Vacuous concepts to believe in. Slogans. Yellow ribbons. Novelty flags. It's all yours: the flag is wrapped
        around your mouth, and the ribbon's tied around your neck. Propaganda is to Democracy what the bludgeon is to
        a Totalitarian state.<br />
        <br />


      <p><b>GOOD NIGHT</b></p>

      A face in the sand brushed away by the hand<br />
      Our memory, gone with the wind<br />
      We know nothing, and never will<br />
      We never choose to dig our own graves<br />
      <p></p>
      Take pleasure in sin before it's too late<br />
      For tomorrow it will be too late<br />
      You will disappear like a fading smile<br />
      And will be re-cast like the toss of the die<br />
      <p></p>
      CHORUS:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We held on to the rail till our knuckles turned white<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waited for morning to come<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the horizon, we never looked back<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last toast, the last dance<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good night<br />
      <p></p>
      CHORUS
      <p></p>
      The howl of the wind never leaves a trace<br />
      We always choose to live as someone<br />
      Companion to none, or a knife in the back<br />
      Passively waiting for the right time to come<br />
      <p></p>
      Take pleasure in sin before it's too late<br />
      We know tomorrow will be too late<br />
      All is in vain; your prayers mean nothing<br />
      The last toast, the last dance<br />
      This is good night<br />
      <p></p>
      CHORUS
      <p></p>
      The last toast, the last dance<br />
      Good night<br />
      <p></p>
      The last toast, the last dance<br />
      Good night<br />
      <p></p>
      The last toast, the last dance<br />
      This is good night<br />
      <br />

      <p><b>SOVIET K&#214;LPONY</b></p>

      Last night the sky changed colors again<br />
      The ever-shifting horizon &#60;undulating&#62;<br />
      A light switch<br />
      Memory explodes<br />
      The nocturnal shards that introduce morning...<br />
      Like crayons of wax
      <p></p>
      The bubbles rise up from the lips (&#60;fzz! fzzz!&#62;)<br />
      And every night<br />
      From each ear, eye, and curious cavity<br />
      Colors of all shapes and sizes<br />
      Past and Simple Past<br />
      Never to be reckoned with<br />
      Always to be scrubbed and cleaned<br />
      A clean slate<br />
      Editors and publishers...<br />
      It's the history of the world<br />
      <br />

      <p><b>CINDER</b></p>

      You are nothing<br />
      A black pile of ashes<br />
      Set from within<br />
      You're a human candle<br />
      I stare at your feet and take in the lingering vapor<br />
      There's nothing in the room and nothing upstairs<br />
      Matching denseness sprouts from the heap of your remains<br />
      Taints the soil you walk and others who follow<br />
      You feed the machine<br />
      It acts as your lover<br />
      Coquettishly it laughs<br />
      It wants no other kind<br />
      It feeds you matches under a watery sky<br />
      I wish I could ignite everybody else like you<br />
      <p></p>
      Always nothing<br />
      You stuff your face with deceit<br />
      You eat off the plate in shadow of two-faced coins<br />
      Feeding your clay figure<br />
      So easily moldable<br />
      You start to sense the sparks<br />
      You quickly want to change sides<br />
      Your hair starts burning right up from the roots<br />
      Your crystal head is next<br />
      I always saw through you<br />
      An uneasiness begins in your knees<br />
      As a smile emerges on our faces<br />
      And you fall to the earth in a pulp<br />
      I want to see you go down with a flame<br />
      <br />


      <p><b>HEISTERBUSCH 14</b></p>

      When you move<br />
      The saw plays in the background<br />
      Every movement<br />
      A Dutch inflection<br />
      Each attempt at rest<br />
      Punches a hole in your dimension<br />
      It is the third<br />
      But, do we share it?<br />
      <p></p>
      A windmill crucifixion<br />
      A line of ducks to cross the street<br />
      In single file<br />
      With iron boots<br />
      Try to sew your eyes shut<br />
      No voyage to Mars will render you blind<br />
      And gluttony's a virtue<br />
      And recognition never pays<br />
      <p></p>
      In search of fine cathedrals<br />
      Christ's message on a postcard<br />
      Paper dolls lay empty in a tunnel<br />
      The needle passed, the blue light flickers<br />
      Glance at the reflection before you<br />
      A pile of vomit<br />
      The lady of the lake<br />
      The dew upon the horse's hooves<br />
      <p></p>
      Throw potatoes into caves<br />
      All familiar corpses lie within<br />
      Watering the plants and flowers<br />
      The blooming skulls, the photographs<br />
      Death is photogenic, dear<br />
      Babbles in a foreign tongue<br />
      Language as exquisite corpse<br />
      The skin inside the closet hangs<br />
      <br />

      <p><b>LATERNE</b></p>

      I want to be a hat<br />
      I want to be a hat<br />
      So I can walk around with you<br />
      Wherever you go<br />
      Where ever you go<br />
      And when you're not looking<br />
      I'll peek into your skull<br />
      And see what you're thinking<br />
      <p></p>
      I could be a building<br />
      In a modern city<br />
      Standing with the others<br />
      But, they wouldn't understand<br />
      They wouldn't understand<br />
      The nurturing aspects of my intentions<br />
      They'd bar their doors<br />
      And board their windows<br />
      But not me<br />
      No, not me!<br />
      <p></p>
      I want to be a hole in the ground<br />
      A big, black hole to swallow you up<br />
      But, not just any hole<br />
      One with a strong, iron lid<br />
      Like a doorway to the sewers<br />
      So I can take you in<br />
      And astonish you<br />
      With my amazing hospitality<br />
      I will feed you<br />
      And I will study you<br />
      And I will feed you<br />
      Until I earn your trust<br />
      And then...<br />
      <br />

      <p><b>MARZIPAN MOON</b></p>

      Pop stars and idols<br />
      They are stapled to the wall<br />
      This piss-colored wall<br />
      Or maybe not<br />
      Perhaps it is merely stained<br />
      Like the vision inside my mind<br />
      And so I sleep with these girls<br />
      Of whom I do not know<br />
      (Though some I do)<br />
      They belong to someone else<br />
      We share the same blood<br />
      And they stare down upon me<br />
      Night after night<br />
      With the same exact gaze<br />
      And those lips and those thighs<br />
      Yes, they are always the same<br />
      And with pursed lips, they remind me<br />
      Yes, they remind me every night<br />
      Sometimes at one, or at three, or at four<br />
      In the morning<br />
      They remind me<br />
      Nee, urge me<br />
      That I'd better decide<br />
      I'd better decide<br />
      Before the blood in this room laps me<br />
      For right now<br />
      It's twelve years and counting<br />
      Only twelve years, but gaining<br />
      This blood<br />
      This stain<br />
      <p></p>
      And the glare that circles the room<br />
      It flutters about my head like a moth<br />
      This way and that way<br />
      And which way to that way?<br />
      Always the glare<br />
      And though I seem to think<br />
      That the glare comes from the mice<br />
      That hang from the ceiling<br />
      I could be wrong<br />
      For here you can never tell<br />
      You can never be sure<br />
      Because of those stains upon the wall<br />
      <br />

      <p>"Meet me at the station," was what she said before everything in her life came crashing down upon her. She
        was a victim of ideas. She was a monument to herself, which in itself was created by bricks and stones held
        together by nothing else than more ideas. "Quickly now..." You'd miss the train. Stumble through those
        streets of Europe. Pick up matches along the way. Points of interest lead to sparks. Another good idea along
        the way. Shake hands with the corpse. Another good idea. Yes: an irregular pulse. Head weighs a ton.</p>

      <p>The chocolate-brown coat with the feathery trimming flutters in the distance. She's a speckle up ahead.
        She's a spot on the horizon. Catch her with binoculars. We know that there are bandits. And time will
        sabotage the future. The dartboard hangs upon your back. A bull's eye in the dark. A good shot in the back.
        My best friend holds the darts. My favorite enemy holds the cards.</p>

      <p>"Hurry up, you'll miss the train." Stepping over curbs. Sidestepping over selfish minutes. Whisking by the
        addicts with the blue horse in the tunnel. Skipping stones and skipping rhymes. Up ahead: a flagpole in the
        ground. Say your farewells quickly, and then run. Go go go go go...</p>

      <p>The chocolate-brown coat flutters in the distance. Time has sabotaged the future. My best friend holds the
        darts, and my favorite enemy holds the cards.<br />
