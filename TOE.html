T.O.E. originally began as a cover project, recording covers from bands and artists like Neil Young, The Mekons, Mot&#246;rhead, Donovan, Robbie Fulks, Robyn Hitchcock, New Model Army, and more. The two then moved on to writing original material, both contributing equally to the songwriting process.</p>
            <p>T.O.E. recorded one album, <i>Autonomy or Bust</i> (2003). They continued writing and recording following the album, though none of the music was released. All of the music was recorded on a 4-track. The two continued as T.O.E. until 2005.</p>
